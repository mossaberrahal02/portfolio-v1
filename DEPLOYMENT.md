# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/mossaberrahal02/portfolio-v1`
2. Click on **Settings** tab (top right of the repository)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (not Deploy from a branch)
5. Click **Save**

### 2. Verify Workflow Deployment

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see a workflow run called "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. Wait for it to complete (green checkmark)
4. Once complete, your site will be available at:
   ```
   https://mossaberrahal02.github.io/portfolio-v1/
   ```

### 3. Automatic Updates

- Every time you push changes to the `main` branch, your site will automatically update
- The deployment typically takes 1-3 minutes to complete

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If the workflow fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
3. Make sure the source is set to "GitHub Actions"

### If the site doesn't load:
1. Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation
2. Check if the deployment completed successfully
3. Verify the URL format: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`

### Custom Domain (Optional)
If you want to use a custom domain:
1. Add a `CNAME` file to the root directory with your domain name
2. Configure DNS settings with your domain provider
3. Update the repository settings under Pages > Custom domain
